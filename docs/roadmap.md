# Milestones and explicitly deferred work

The next-generation specification is delivered in coherent releases. Version 0.4 completes the Coverage milestone; it does not claim that the Evidence Intelligence and Temporal Research milestones have shipped. Existing investigations and safety boundaries remain supported.

| Specification sections | 0.4 disposition |
| --- | --- |
| 1–2: strengths and architecture | Preserved; separate provider catalog, capability, credential, health, diversity and benchmark modules added. Full future architecture is not populated with placeholder classes. |
| 3–13: discovery providers, credentials, configuration, health, diversity | Implemented with documented per-API limits. OS keychain UI deferred; environment and injectable secure-store interface are usable. |
| 14–15: planning and multilingual search | Mechanical spelling, suffix, initials/acronym, handle, transliteration and quoted-query candidates; explicit script/origin/state; 25 label languages and provider routing. Source-backed aliases continue to work. Automatic official-site, historical-name and identifier expansion awaits 0.5/0.6. |
| 16: translation | Existing protocol and original-text preservation retained. External/offline translation integration deferred; no translation service is silently enabled. |
| 17–18: ranking and benchmark | Native ranks retained; versioned offline fixture benchmark added. Production ranking weights unchanged. RRF and semantic reranking deferred pending comparative evidence. |
| 19–23: entities, claims, lineage, Wikidata properties, more specialized sources | Deferred to 0.5. Existing identifier observations and label candidates remain; no assertion-level Claim model or independence claim is fabricated. |
| 24–30: clearnet HTML/PDF, archive content, timelines and diffs | Deferred to 0.6. Common Crawl capture metadata is implemented; arbitrary destinations, WARC/PDF downloads and arbitrary onion fetching remain disabled. |
| 31–38: adaptation, convergence, persistence journal and graph/contradictions | Local health orders later-pass work without suppressing providers. Full marginal-yield scheduling, claim graph, contradiction candidates, incremental storage and event journal deferred. Existing bounded persistent queue and history remain. |
| 39–41: results, Coverage and provenance | Discovery observations, multi-index badges, grouped provider health/configuration, warnings, script/kind query plan and exports implemented. Claim-centric views wait for 0.5. |
| 42–48: pivots, deduplication, authority and evidence | Manual known URL/domain lookup, existing stable-ID/hash/near-text deduplication and conservative relevance preserved. Automatic domain/identifier pivots, stronger syndication/authority models and scale work deferred. No LLM dependency added. |
| 49–58: exports, CLI, profiles, budgets, freshness, planner, network/cache/ranks | Implemented for Coverage records. Claims, timelines, graph exchange formats and live benchmark corpus management remain deferred. Filter support is explicit per provider. |
| 59–60: 10,000-record performance and virtualization | Hard budget ceiling exposed but 10,000-record performance is not claimed validated. Existing 60-card incremental display preserved. Full scale profiling and model/view migration are deferred to 0.6. |
| 61–64: releases, CI, live checks, governance | Source/native build scripts, release workflow, nine OS/Python checks, three native smoke builds, dependency audit and opt-in live checks added. Signing/notarization and enforcing hosted branch rules require repository/account configuration. See releases documentation. |
| 65–71: security, privacy, tests, docs, provider matrix and SDK | Updated for implemented features. Future PDF/DNS/claim controls are explicitly described as prerequisites, not claimed existing features. No deprecated third-party provider is a required dependency. |
| 72–75: milestone quality and completion | 0.4 changes are exposed through GUI/CLI, persisted, exported and tested. Live paid APIs and cross-platform builds are only claimed verified when actual evidence exists. |

## 0.5 — Evidence Intelligence

Introduce immutable observations as the dependency for richer entities, assertion-level claims, publication/archive/syndication lineage, conservative source-independence groups, Wikidata property enrichment, and contradiction candidates. Build claim/evidence views and exports only after these contracts and migration tests exist. Shared URLs or matching names never prove a person/entity identity. Search index agreement remains discovery agreement.

## 0.6 — Temporal Research

Design a separate document-fetch context with public-IP/DNS validation on every redirect, credential-free requests, robots policies, decoded byte limits, content-type checks, process-isolated PDF parsing and deadline enforcement. Add archive content, first/last observation, timelines and refresh diffs. Move snapshot rewrites to incremental normalized records and an event journal; measure 10,000-record save, reopen, filter and render costs before choosing UI virtualization. Arbitrary onion destinations remain outside automatic retrieval.
